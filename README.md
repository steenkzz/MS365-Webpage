# MS365-Webpage
Originally required to make a single instruction manual of Sharepoint for a school assignment, 
became a webpage with (almost) all of MS365's manuals hosted.

The webpage includes:
• Word
• Powerpoint
• Excel
• OneNote
• Outlook
• Publisher
• Sharepoint
• OneDrive
• Teams
• Skype
• Access
• To Do
• Planner
• Yammer
• Delve

This is purely an extension of my assigned assignment from school during internship.
